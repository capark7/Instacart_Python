# Instacart Analysis - Python

### SUMMARY
A data analysis project with Instacart Grocery Basket data. Analysis and visualizations performed with Python.

### OBJECTIVES
* Clean and merge four data sets: orders, products, department, and customer data.

* Analyze the data to answer questions from marketing and sales teams (for example, busiest times of day, highest grossing days of the week, most popular groups of products, most loyal customers, etc.).

* Analyze the data to discover differences in users’ ordering habits based various characteristics (such as region, income, loyalty status, etc.).

* Create customer profiles based on combinations of variables and analyze how their ordering behaviors may differ (for instance: pet owners, vegetarian/vegan, etc.).

### DATA
Order and product information borrowed with permission from “The Instacart Online Grocery Shopping Dataset 2017.” Accessed on 3/10/2023. Available [here](https://www.instacart.com/datasets/grocery-shopping-2017Opensource).

Customer data was fabricated for this project by Career Foundary for this project. Available [here](https://s3.amazonaws.com/coach-courses-us/public/courses/data-immersion/A4/A4_Data_Assets/customers.zip).

### TOOLS

*Language:* Python

*Libraries:* Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, and Scipy

*Software:* Jupyter Notebooks and Excel

### SKILLS DEMONSTRATED

* **Cleaning data:** removed duplicates, found and resolved missing values, addressed mixed or incorrect data types, checked for outliers/errors and fixed them.

* **Merging data:** selected and prepared data for merging, confirmed merge was successful, and exported final merge as a pkl file.

* **Exploratory analysis:** explored basic descriptive statistics (max/min, quartiles, mean, standard deviation) for each variable as well as using histograms, scatterplots, and bar and line charts to explore the distributions of data. 

* **Derived new variables:** grouped data by user, order, and department to allow exploration and analysis at each level; used aggregated data to create flags about user ordering habits (such as ‘new customer’, ‘loyal customer’, etc.) and demographic info (such as ‘vegetarian’ or ‘pet owner’); confirmed the new data created via crosstabs and value counts.

* **Visualizing data:** used Matplotlib and Seaborn to create histograms, line charts, pie charts, and bar charts (vertical/horizontal, stacked, and 100% stacked). Customized colors, legends, labels and annotations for clarity and visual consistency.

* **Reporting results:** provided an Excel file that explained the answers to questions from sales/marketing as well as documenting the data population flow, consistency checks, data wrangling, and column derivations.
